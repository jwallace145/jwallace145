## About Me

Hello 👋

My name is Jimmy and I am a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience developing applications at enterprise companies like [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Charter Communications](https://corporate.charter.com/)

I enjoy developing side projects in my free time and like to contribute to open source projects that I am interested in. I am always open to new ideas and opportunities to collaborate with other developers looking to build something 🔨

Aside from computer science and engineering, I am an avid music listener and amateur guitar player that rock climbs when I can 🪨

## Projects
