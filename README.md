## About Me

Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jimmy and I am a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience developing applications at enterprise companies like [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I enjoy developing side projects in my free time and like to contribute to open source projects that I am interested in. I am always open to new ideas and opportunities to collaborate with other developers looking to build something ðŸ”¨

Aside from computer science and engineering, I am an avid music listener and amateur guitar player that rock climbs when I can ðŸª¨
