## About Me

Hello 👋

My name is Jimmy, and I am a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building applications and platforms at enterprise companies like [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Charter Communications](https://corporate.charter.com/).

I primarily develop backend services for distributed systems hosted in the cloud, often focusing on big data computing. I work with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Go](https://go.dev/), but I enjoy exploring new languages. On the frontend, I build with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). For infrastructure, I prefer [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform), though I am familiar with other IaC tools as well.

I often work on side projects that I use personally or create for learning purposes. I am also passionate about open-source and enjoy collaborating with other developers 🔨

Outside of software, I am an avid music listener, amateur guitar player, and rock climber. Many of my projects intersect with these personal interests 🚀
